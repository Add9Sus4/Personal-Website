# Personal Website

This is the code for the website I am developing. Eventually I plan to have all of my coding work, blog posts, 
and music available at this website. When I start my own audio software company, I will either use this site
or start a new one.

The site is not up and running just yet, but I plan to deploy on heroku soon and link a domain name to it
so that people can find it.

Right now my information is scattered across the internet - my music is on soundcloud, my code is here on GitHub
and on my local machine, and my blog is on Wordpress. I hope to use this website to condense everything to
one location.
